### Rate limiting

To limit brute-forcing of passphrases, **S-Keyfender** rate limits logins. The rate for the unlock passphrase is enforced globally (at the moment at most 10 accesses per second). The rate limit for all endpoints requiring authentication is 10 per second per IP address.

# Reset to factory defaults (when unlock passphrase is lost)

# Reading output from serial console

# Error conditions
